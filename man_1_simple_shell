.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.B PATH 

PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, 
specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. In general, 
each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting.

.B ENVIRON

This variable, when and only  when  an  interactive  shell  is  invoked,  shall  be
subjected  to  parameter expansion (see Parameter Expansion ) by the shell, and the resulting 
value shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell commands  to
execute  in  the  current  environment.

.B PWD 

Pwd stands for Print Working Directory. It prints the path of the working directory, starting from the root.
pwd is shell built-in command(pwd) or an actual binary(/bin/pwd).
